                  <p class="paratext">
                     Hepburn was born Audrey Kathleen Ruston or Edda Kathleen Hepburn-Ruston on 4 May 1929 in Brussels, Belgium.
                  </p>
                  <p class="paratext">
                     Her father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (1889–1980), was a British subject born in Auschitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary. He was the son of Victor John George Ruston, of British and Austrian descent and Anna Wels, of Austrian descent.  Although born with the surname Ruston, he later double-barrelled his name to the more "aristocratic" Hepburn-Ruston, mistakenly believing himself descended from James Hepburn, third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.
                  </p>
                  <p class="paratext">
                     Hepburn's mother, Ella van Heemstra (1900–1984), was a Dutch baroness. At age nineteen, Ella had married Jonkheer Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, an oil executive based in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, where they subsequently lived. They had two sons, Jonkheer Arnoud Robert Alexander Quarles van Ufford (1920–1979) and Jonkheer Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford (1924–2010), before divorcing in 1925.
                  </p>
                  <p class="paratext">
                     Hepburn's parents were married in Batavia in September 1926. At the time, Ruston worked for a trading company, but soon after the marriage, the couple relocated to Europe, where he began working for a loan company. After a year in London, they moved to Brussels, where he had been assigned to open a branch office. After three years spent travelling between Brussels, Arnhem, The Hague and London, the family settled in the suburban Brussels municipality of Linkebeek in 1932. Hepburn's early childhood was sheltered and privileged. As a result of her multinational background and travelling with her family due to her father's job, she learned to speak five languages: Dutch and English from her parents, and later French, Spanish, and Italian. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn#Family_and_early_childhood_.281929.E2.80.931938.29">Read More</a>

                     <p class="paratext">
                        After Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Hepburn's mother relocated her daughter back to Arnhem in the hope that, as during World War I, the Netherlands would remain neutral and be spared a German attack. While there, Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945. She had begun taking ballet lessons during her last years at boarding school, and continued training in Arnhem under the tutelage of Winja Marova, becoming her "star pupil". After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hepburn used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an "English-sounding" name was considered dangerous during the German occupation. Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that "had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves".
                     </p>
                     <p class="paratext">
                        In addition to other traumatic events, she witnessed the transportation of Dutch Jews to concentration camps, later stating that "more than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on the train. I was a child observing a child."
                     </p>
                     <p class="paratext">
                        After the Allied landing on D-Day, living conditions grew worse and Arnhem was subsequently heavily damaged during Operation Market Garden. Like others, Hepburn's family resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits; she developed acute anæmia, respiratory problems and edema as a result of malnutrition. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn#Experiences_during_World_War_II_.281939.E2.80.931945.29">Read More</a>

                        After the war ended in 1945, Hepburn moved with her mother and siblings to Amsterdam, where she began ballet training under Sonia Gaskell, and Russian Olga Tarassova. Hepburn made her film debut in 1948, playing an air stewardess in Dutch in Seven Lessons, an educational travel film. Later that year, she moved to London to take up a ballet scholarship with Ballet Rambert. She supported herself with part-time work as a model, and dropped "Ruston" from her surname. After she was told by Rambert that despite her talent, her height and weak constitution (the after-effect of wartime malnutrition) would make the status of prima ballerina unattainable, she decided to concentrate on acting.
                     </p>
                     <p class="paratext">
                        Hepburn appeared as a chorus girl in the West End musical theatre revues High Button Shoes (1948) at the London Hippodrome, and Cecil Landeau's Sauce Tartare (1949) and Sauce Piquante (1950) at the Cambridge Theatre. During her theatrical work, she took elocution lessons with actor Felix Aylmer to develop her voice. She was spotted by a casting director and was registered as a freelance actress with the Associated British Picture Corporation. She appeared in minor roles before being cast in her first major supporting role in The Secret People (1952), in which she played a prodigious ballerina, performing all of her own dancing sequences.

                     <p class="paratext">
                        Hepburn was then offered a small role in a film being shot in both English and French, Monte Carlo Baby (French:Nous Irons à Monte Carlo,1952), which was filmed in Monte Carlo. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn#Ballet_studies_and_early_acting_roles_.281945.E2.80.931952.29">Read more</a>

                        In the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programmes for UNICEF, re-telling chldren's stories of war. In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF. On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organisation.

                        Hepburn's first field mission for UNICEF was to Ethiopia in 1988. She visited an orphanage in Mek'ele that housed 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food. In August 1988 Hepburn went to Turkey on an immunisation campaign. She called Turkey "the loveliest example" of UNICEF's capabilities.

                        In October, Hepburn went to South America. Of her experiences in Venezuela and Ecuador, Hepburn told the United States Congress, "I saw tiny mountain communities, slums, and shantytowns receive water systems for the first time by some miracle – and the miracle is UNICEF. I watched boys build their own schoolhouse with bricks and cement provided by UNICEF."

                        Hepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and met with leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders as part of a mission called "Operation Lifeline". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn#Humanitarian_career">Read more..</a>
